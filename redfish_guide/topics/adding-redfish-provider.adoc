This will reveal fields to describe the endpoint of the new {redfish-provider-full}.
Populate them as needed:

To proceed, click *Validate*. If the credential validation was successful, click
*Add*. The Physical Infrastructure Providers list will display the new provider:

It takes about a minute before the inventory gets populated for the first time,
so use the browser's refresh function to obtain an updated status.
