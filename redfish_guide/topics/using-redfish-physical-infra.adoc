== Using {redfish-provider-full-title}

=== Examining {redfish-provider-title} Inventory

The physical infrastructure provider's dashboard provides an overview of the
inventory at a glance. To view it, first navigate to *Compute ->
Physical Infrastructure -> Providers* page from the main navigation on the
left, then click your {redfish-provider}.

NOTE: The {redfish-provider} does not support targeted refreshing of the
inventory. To make sure that the latest information is visible, please perform
*Configuration -> Refresh Relationships and Power States*. The statuses should
be up-to-date after a few seconds.

To obtain a tabular view of the inventory, switch to the *Summary View* of the
{redfish-provider}'s dashboard:

image::docs_redfish_using02_dashboard_summary.png[alt="Summary view of {redfish-provider} dashboard",500,align="center"]

To view a list of the resources discovered through the inventory, click on
the respective row of the *Relationships* table. For example, clicking on
the *Physical Servers* row will take you to the list of physical servers:

A graphical representation of the managed data center can be displayed by
navigating to *Compute -> Physical Infrastructure -> Topology*:

=== Identifying physical systems

Many physical servers are equipped with a LED for identifying it as a specific
unit. Please use the server's documentation to locate it on the server's
chassis.

To identify a single system or a specific set of physical systems, we start by
making sure that all the LEDs are off. To do this, we visit *Compute -> Physical
Infrastructure -> Servers* from the navigation on the left. Here, we can see
from the *LED State* column the current states of the identifying LED for the
servers. To select all servers, we click on the *Select All* checkbox at the
bottom of the page. Now the *Identify* menu becomes active:

image::docs_redfish_using04_all_servers.png[alt="Identify menu and current state of the identify LED for the servers in the inventory",500,align="center"]

From the *Identify* menu, we click the *Turn Off LED*. We confirm the action
by clicking *OK* in the confirmation prompt that appears in the browser. Then
we should see the status showing the success of sending the request:

image::docs_redfish_using05_turn_off_led.png[alt="Confirmation of successfully requesting to turn off the LED",300,align="center"]

The LEDs on the servers should be off within a few seconds. To see the updated
status in the {product-gui}, use the *Configuration -> Refresh Relationships
and Power States*, wait a few seconds, then refresh the page in the browser.

image::docs_redfish_using06_refresh.png[alt="Refreshing the inventory status",200,align="center"]

To control the LED for an individual server, we can first click on the physical
server's name in the table. We obtain the physical server's summary view, which
provides the same *Identify* menu as before. Here, we can also see the state
of the identification LED:

image::docs_redfish_using03_identify.png[alt="Identify menu and current state of the identify LED",400,align="center"]

To make the server's identification LED blink, we click *Identify -> Blink
LED*. We get a prompt for confirming the action. After clicking *OK*, the
{product-gui} shows confirmation of the request sent. Shortly afterwards, the
selected server's LED should start blinking.

To see the status updated in the {product-gui}, we use the *Configuration ->
Refresh Relationships and Power States* function, then after a few seconds we
refresh the page in the browser.

Please refer to the <<ReleaseNotesRedfish>> section for further information
about the identify LED management actions and statuses.

=== Managing the Physical System's Power Status

Physical servers may be remotely powered off, powered on or restarted through
{product-gui} using {redfish-provider}.

To power off a particular physical server, we first navigate to *Compute ->
Physical Infrastructure -> Servers* from the navigation on the left. On the
server list, we click on the server's name. This takes us to the server's
summary page, which provides the *Power* menu and displays the server's
current power state:

image::docs_redfish_using08_server_power_on.png[alt="Power menu and current state of the power to the server",500,align="center"]

We can see that the server is currently powered on. To have it powered off, we
click on *Power -> Power Off Immediately*. We get a prompt to confirm the
selected action. After we click *Ok*, we will see the status showing the success
of sending the request:

image::docs_redfish_using09_turn_off_power.png[alt="Confirmation of successfully requesting to turn off the server immediately",300,align="center"]

The server should be powered off within a few seconds. To see the updated
status in the {product-gui}, use the *Configuration -> Refresh Relationships
and Power States*, wait a few seconds, then refresh the page in the browser.
Subject to server's vendor's {redfish} implementation, the power status should
cycle from *On* over *PoweringOff* to finally *Off*.

To turn on all the physical servers in a single batch operation, we visit
*Compute -> Physical Infrastructure -> Servers* from the navigation on
the left. Here, we can see from the *Power State* column the current states of
the power supply for the servers. To select all servers, we click on the *Select
All* checkbox at the bottom of the page. Now the *Power* menu becomes
active:

image::docs_redfish_using10_all_servers.png[alt="Power menu and current power state of the servers in the inventory"]

From the *Power* menu, we click the *Power On*. We confirm the action
by clicking *OK* in the confirmation prompt that appears in the browser. Then
we should see the status showing the success of sending the request.

The servers should be powered on within a few seconds. To see the updated
status in the {product-gui}, use the *Configuration -> Refresh Relationships
and Power States*, wait a few seconds, then refresh the page in the browser.
Again depending on the {redfish} implementation, the statuses will cycle from
*Off* to *PoweringOn* and finally to *On*.

Please refer to the <<ReleaseNotesRedfish>> section for further information
about the power management actions and statuses.
